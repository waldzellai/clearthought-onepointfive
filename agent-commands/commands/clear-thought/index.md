# Clear-Thought Commands

Advanced reasoning and thinking workflows powered by the Clear-Thought MCP server. These commands provide structured approaches to complex problem-solving, decision-making, and creative thinking.

## Available Commands

### ðŸ§  Core Thinking Workflows

- **[/think-solve](think-solve.md)** - Complete problem-solving pipeline from initial thoughts to conclusions
- **[/think-decide](think-decide.md)** - Multi-perspective decision making with confidence tracking
- **[/think-create](think-create.md)** - Generate novel solutions through creative-systems thinking
- **[/think-debug](think-debug.md)** - Systematic debugging with root cause analysis
- **[/think-research](think-research.md)** - Deep research with hypothesis testing and confidence tracking
- **[/think-strategy](think-strategy.md)** - Complex initiative planning with systems perspective

## How These Commands Work

Each command leverages multiple Clear-Thought tools in sophisticated sequences:

1. **Sequential Thinking** - Break down complex problems into manageable thoughts
2. **Mental Models** - Apply proven frameworks like first principles, Pareto principle
3. **Scientific Method** - Test hypotheses systematically
4. **Collaborative Reasoning** - Gather multiple perspectives
5. **Systems Thinking** - Understand interconnections and feedback loops
6. **Metacognitive Monitoring** - Track confidence and adjust approach

## Key Features

- **Session Management**: All workflows support saving/resuming progress
- **Memory Integration**: Insights are stored in mem0 for future reference
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple thinking tools run concurrently when beneficial
- **Export Options**: Generate reports in JSON, markdown, or visual formats
- **Quality Metrics**: Track confidence scores, iterations, and convergence

## Integration with Other Commands

Clear-Thought commands work seamlessly with:
- `/swarm-intelligence` - Combine multiple agent perspectives with structured thinking
- `/code-analysis` - Apply systematic thinking to code understanding
- `/web-research` - Structure findings from web searches
- `/perplexity-search` - Enhance search results with deep analysis

## Getting Started

Choose a command based on your need:
- **Problem to solve?** â†’ `/think-solve`
- **Decision to make?** â†’ `/think-decide`
- **Need creative ideas?** â†’ `/think-create`
- **Bug to fix?** â†’ `/think-debug`
- **Topic to research?** â†’ `/think-research`
- **Strategy to develop?** â†’ `/think-strategy`

Each command accepts natural language input and guides you through a structured thinking process.
