# Scientific Method Examples

## Productivity Research

### Remote Work Impact Study

```json
{
  "prompt": "Does remote work increase productivity?",
  "parameters": {
    "stage": "conclusion",
    "hypothesis": "Remote work increases productivity by 15% due to reduced commute stress and flexible hours",
    "experiment": "A/B test with control group in office and test group remote for 3 months",
    "observations": [
      "Remote group completed 18% more tasks",
      "Remote group reported 25% higher satisfaction",
      "In-office group had better collaboration scores",
      "Remote group had 12% fewer sick days",
      "Meeting time decreased by 30% for remote group",
      "Code review turnaround improved by 22% remotely"
    ],
    "analysis": "Statistical significance achieved (p<0.05) for productivity increase. Effect size Cohen's d=0.7 indicating moderate to large effect.",
    "conclusion": "Remote work does increase individual productivity but may impact team collaboration. Hybrid model recommended."
  }
}
```

## User Experience Research

### Interface Design Testing

```json
{
  "prompt": "Does dark mode reduce eye strain?",
  "parameters": {
    "stage": "analysis",
    "hypothesis": "Dark mode interfaces reduce eye strain by 30% in low-light conditions",
    "experiment": "Controlled study with 100 users, randomized between dark and light modes, measuring eye strain metrics",
    "observations": [
      "Blink rate increased 15% with light mode",
      "Subjective discomfort scores 40% higher in light mode",
      "Reading speed 5% faster in dark mode",
      "Accuracy unchanged between modes",
      "Pupil dilation 20% less in dark mode",
      "Fatigue onset 25 minutes later with dark mode"
    ],
    "analysis": "Significant reduction in eye strain indicators with dark mode. Multiple metrics support hypothesis.",
    "conclusion": ""
  }
}
```

## Algorithm Performance Study

### Cache Optimization Research

```json
{
  "prompt": "Will implementing an LRU cache improve API response times?",
  "parameters": {
    "stage": "experiment",
    "hypothesis": "LRU cache will reduce average API response time by 40% for frequently accessed data",
    "experiment": "Deploy cache to 50% of servers, measure response times over 2 weeks, control for request patterns",
    "observations": [],
    "analysis": "",
    "conclusion": ""
  }
}
